__Abstract__: The sectarian conflicts in the Middle East have heightened Sunni-Shiʿa sectarian tensions in the broader Islamic world. This dissertation examines the dynamic of Sunni-Shiʿa sectarianization in Indonesia. Unlike other studies that have been rooted in an assumption of fixed-normative notions of Sunnism and Shiʿism, it looks beyond the perceived doctrines, orthodoxies, and boundaries that are ordinarily understood to delineate Sunni and Shiʿa identity. This work is based on a combination of library research and multi-site fieldwork in Indon esia in 2015 and 2018. Over one hundred interviews were conducted with Muslim interlocutors from diverse backgrounds across Indonesia on subjects pertaining to their understanding of Sunni and Shiʿa identity, narratives, and boundaries.
Using the theoretical framework of sectarianization, which views Shiʿism and Shiʿa identity as mutable, this study offers a thick description of the multifaceted and ever-changing understanding of Shiʿism in Indonesia. It explores how Indonesian Muslims experience and express sectarian sentiments, as well as how sectarian discourse has traveled globally and been internalized locally. It demonstrates that local, national, and transnational political changes have influenced Islamic discursive practices in Indonesia, including the ways Indonesian Muslims discuss and construe Shiʿism.
The rise of Sunni-Shiʿa sectarianization in Indonesia is evident in the increasing articulation of sectarian consciousness among lay Muslims, the growth of anti-Shiʿa propaganda, and the consolidation and mobilization of anti-Shiʿa Sunni groups. By employing the narrative identity approach of Walter Fisher, Margaret Somers, and Gloria Gibson, this dissertation analyzes how Indonesian Muslims acquire, maintain, and negotiate their sectarian affiliations by “emplotting” themselves in historical, theological, cultural, and political narratives. It argues that the sectarianization process affects the way Indonesian Muslims read and interpret the historical narratives concerning Shiʿism, the way they signify and perform personal and cultural sectarian identifications, and the way authorities formulate and deploy public policies. This study sought to enrich the growing scholarship of sectarianization that, in general, has been focused on the Middle East and South Asian regions.
