  The purpose of the overall project is to examine in the history of Salafi religious movements in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore between 1880 and the present. My work includes textual analysis and conducting 15 interviews on contemporary aspects of Salafi movements in Indonesia. I selected interviewees from diverse religious organizations, geographic locations, gender, economic class and level of educations. I translated the interviews transcripts from Bahasa Indonesia to English and wrote a short report on profiling the interviewees.

For my personal site I've toned it down a bit. Instead of a flashy sidebar image, I chose a solid background color.
However, I've given [certain](https://qwtel.com/projects/ducky-hunting/) [pages](https://qwtel.com/projects/blocky-blocks/) big sidebar images,
and let Hydejack blend back to normal when the user navigates away.

While I love the font used for Hydejack's headings, for my personal site I felt less of a need to control the typesetting.
That's why I'm not using Google Fonts, and instead use whatever is the default for the reader's operating system.

```yml
google_fonts: false
font:         system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", "Roboto", "Oxygen", "Ubuntu", "Cantarell", "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
font_heading: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", "Roboto", "Oxygen", "Ubuntu", "Cantarell", "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
```

The configuration I use to enable the system font on my site. Feel free to copy!
