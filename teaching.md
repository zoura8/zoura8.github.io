## ES 663 CEE: Religion, Violence, and Peacebuilding (Fall 2012), Emory University.

Teaching Associate to Dr. Ellen Ott Marshall. “Religion, Violence, and Peacebuilding” explores contexts in which religion has been a contributing factor to violence and also a mechanism for peacebuilding.  We focus on Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland.  Sarah Muwahidah and Rebekka King will lead class sessions on religious conflict in Indonesia and Québec respectively.  For each section of the course, we do some background reading before focusing on the role of religion in the conflict and the responses of religious peacebuilders.  Students also reflect on their own context by completing a conflict analysis, envisioning peacebuilding responses, and generate from their context a set of questions about the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding.
